            Indian mythology attaches a great significance to Basil by recognizing it as a holy herb. Perhaps, such significance comes from the actual health applications of the herb. Its use is recommended as a first aid in the treatment of respiratory, digestive and skin diseases.
             Apart from these common ailments, Ayurveda also recognizes its use for the diseases ranging up to tumerous growths. Experimental studies identify it to be a highly promising immunomodulator, cytoprotective and anticancer agent.
